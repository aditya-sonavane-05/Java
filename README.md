# Java Basics

Welcome to the Java Basics project! This repository aims to help you learn and understand the fundamental concepts of Java programming.

## Getting Started

To run the Java programs in this project, you will need:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

## Java Overview

Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its portability, simplicity, and versatility. Here are some key points about Java:

- Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, making it easy to organize code into reusable classes and objects.

- Platform-Independent: Java programs are compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- Syntax: Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, making it familiar to those who have experience with these languages.

- Memory Management: Java manages memory automatically through garbage collection, reducing the burden on developers for memory management.

- Standard Library: Java comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of classes and utilities for various tasks.

## Getting Started with Java Basics

This project is designed to introduce you to essential Java programming concepts. It includes several code examples to help you grasp the basics. Here's a brief overview of the topics covered:

1. **HelloWorld**: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Variables**: Demonstrates the usage of variables to store and manipulate data.

3. **Operators**: Shows various types of operators in Java, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

4. **Control Flow**: Illustrates control flow statements like if-else, switch, while loop, for loop, etc.

5. **Arrays**: Explains how to use arrays to store multiple values of the same type.

6. **Methods**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of methods to organize code into reusable blocks.

7. **Classes and Objects**: Shows how to create classes and objects to model real-world entities.

8. **Inheritance**: Illustrates the concept of inheritance, where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another.

9. **Polymorphism**: Explains polymorphism using method overriding to achieve flexibility in object-oriented design.

10. **Exception Handling**: Shows how to handle exceptions gracefully to prevent program crashes.

Feel free to explore each topic and its associated code examples. Modify the code, experiment, and run the programs to see the output. Learning by hands-on practice is a great way to reinforce your understanding of Java.
